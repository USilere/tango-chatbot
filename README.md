Tango RAG Chatbot

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built on top of Tango PDF documentation, designed to provide intelligent, context-aware answers directly from technical reference material. By chunking and embedding Tango documentation into a vector database, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant knowledge and feeds it into a language model to generate accurate, explainable responses. The goal is to create a developer- and engineer-friendly assistant that makes navigating complex Tango documentation faster, easier, and more interactive.
